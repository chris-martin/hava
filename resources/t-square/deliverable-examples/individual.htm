<h1>Individual Design Analysis</h1>

<p>One purpose of Senior Design is to allow you to experience a capstone
project with many open-ended design options.&nbsp; To evaluate your design
experience, we are requiring students to prepare an <b>individual</b>
retrospective analysis of their design experience in CS4911.</p>

<p>The format for this analysis should follow this outline:</p>

<p><b>Name</b></p>

<p><b>Team Name</b></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Brief description of the system you built this semester.</p>

<p><b>Design Issues</b></p>

<p>What were the issues and constraints that this project<span class="GramE">&nbsp;
imposed</span> on your design?&nbsp; What tradeoffs did you have to make in
completing the design?&nbsp; For instance a customer wants both extensibility
and security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did you trade off
between those?&nbsp; Issues refer usually to non-functional type requirements: 
extensibility, portability, ease of use, reliability, performance, etc.</p>

<p><b>Alternative Solutions </b></p>

<p>What were the alternative designs that <b>you</b> considered (this may
include designs you thought about, but that were rejected by you before even
proposing them to the team)?&nbsp; Why were these alternative solutions not
chosen?&nbsp; In hindsight, was there an alternative design that would have
been better than the one chosen and <span class="GramE">implemented.</span></p>

<p><b>Design Rationale</b></p>

<p>From your standpoint as an individual team member, what were the guiding
principles or constraints that led you to adopt the design you did?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What decisions about the design did you make
in order to address the issues and alternative solutions identified in the previous section?<b> <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Traceability</b></p>

<p>Discuss briefly how the use cases map to the conceptual architecture, and
how the detailed design maps to the conceptual architecture<span class="GramE">&nbsp;
Finally</span> discuss how the code maps to the detailed design.</p>

<p><b>Validation</b></p>

<p>How did you validate your design?&nbsp; How did you ensure that the design
you came up with satisfied the customer requirements and would result in the
system the customer wanted?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is how
you validated design – not how you validated the implementation or the
requirements.&nbsp; Checking with the customer is NOT validating your design.</p>

<p><b>Assessment and Reflection<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">This  section is about the <span class="GramE">design<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and</span> not about
the design process. Think about what worked and what didn't work. What would
you have done differently if you knew at the start what you knew at the <span class="GramE">end.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be sure to
address the why!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the most important
section of the document.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Design Process</b></p>

<p>Your team followed some process that resulted in the final design.&nbsp; In
hindsight, how well did that process work?&nbsp; Were there other things that
should have been done to improve the design?</p>
